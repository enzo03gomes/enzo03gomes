## About me

I'm a Chemical Engineering student with an interest in Chemometrics and Material Science, with particular affection for recycling and circular materials.
I believe knowledge should be free for all, and so you can find in my repositories the tools I have implemented throughout my studies. 


## Skills

Proficient in `R`, and experienced with packages such as `torch`.
My projects are often revolving around data analysis and spectrometry.

I have some experience with `MatLab` and `Excel`, but these are by far not my speciality.
I intend to learn `Fortran` soon. 


## Projects

Currently working on:
- FTIR analysis toolkit for `R`
- Standardized plots for `R`

Future projects may include:
- `Fortran` translations for current `R` projects
- Colorblind palette building tools for `R`
